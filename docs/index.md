# GameDepot API

This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

GameDepot is a video game discovery service that helps users explore and find information about video games. Users can search for games by title, category, publisher, or browse by release date and price.

## Quickstart

Get started with GameDepot by retrieving your first game! 

### What you need

* A development system running Windows, MacOS, or Linux
* Git command line tools
* Node.js (current or LTS version)
* json-server version 0.17.4
* Postman desktop app

### Getting your first game

1. Start the GameDepot API server locally:
```bash
   json-server --watch to-do-db-source.json
```

2. In Postman, create a new GET request to:
```
   http://localhost:3000/games/1
```

3. Click **Send**

You should receive a JSON response with details about the first game in the database!

## API reference docs

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
